                I am currently looking into the design for more maps, and you could help with map concepts at our website @:<a href="http://neohazardgames.wixsite.com/neo-hazard-games">neohazardgames.wixsite.com/neo-hazard-games</a>and tell us what you think they should look like, so development can go further. Also we need a new game name any ideas can also be sent to us via the contributions tab.
